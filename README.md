A classic data science project that involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on a set of features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.
A comprehensive project that helps in understanding various aspects of data science, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
An overview of the approach to the project :

>Data Loading: Import the dataset using libraries like Pandas.
>Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns.
>Feature Engineering: Create new features and convert categorical variables into numerical ones.
>Splitting Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.
>Model Training: Train machine learning models using the training data.
>Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing data.
>Visualization: Visualize the results to gain insights.
